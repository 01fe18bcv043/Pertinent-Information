Information Collected of Pick and Place Robot

Robotic pick and place automation speeds up the process of picking parts up and placing them in new locations, increasing production rates.
With many end-of-arm-tooling options available, pick and place robots can be customized to fit specific production requirements. Moving large, small, heavy, or hard-to-handle products can be an easy task to automate in the factory line.
Consistency is also a benefit of using a pick and place system. The robots can be easily programmed and tooled to provide multiple applications if required.
An increase in output with a pick and place robot system offer long-term savings to companies. With the advancements in technology and affordability of robots, more pick and place robotic cells are being installed for automation applications.
A pick and place robot is the one which is used to pick up an object and place it in the desired location. It can be a cylindrical robot providing movement in horizontal, vertical and rotational axes, a spherical robot providing two rotational and one linear movement, an articulate robot or a scara robot (fixed robots with 3 vertical axes rotary arms).

Advantages

Before moving further, let us see few reasons why pick and place robots are preferred:
• They are faster and can get the work done in seconds compared to their human counterparts.
• They are flexible and have the appropriate design.
• They are accurate.
• They increase the safety of the working environment and actually never get tired.
